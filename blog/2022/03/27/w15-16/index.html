                    <h2 id="Deployment-continued"><a href="#Deployment-continued" class="headerlink" title="Deployment continued"></a>Deployment continued</h2><p>As mentioned in the previous blog post, we have been running our backend and frontend on two different servers with two different repositories. This meant that in order to have good communication between the two servers, two virtual machines would have needed to be created with the previous architecture. After more research and coming to learn that Spring Boot can host static files, we decided to combine the two sides together and host the React app within Spring Boot.</p>
<p>After doing this, we were met with the problem of routing. We were advised to use HashRouter from React Router, however this is not good practise for websites. We decided to stick with using BrowserRouter for more user-friendly urls. This proved difficult, as the frontend pages were not easily found. After coding an error catcher to redirect our pages to the currect frontend router, we were left with a working application on one server, following the desired routes correctly. Our website is now accessible on at <a href="http://13.87.78.62/" title="" target="">Clinical QR Kit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Testing-and-Debugging"><a href="#Testing-and-Debugging" class="headerlink" title="Testing and Debugging"></a>Testing and Debugging</h2><p>After deploying, we could extend our testing to both local and live testing. We decided to implement functional, unit, integration and responsive design testing with our code.</p>
<p>Unit testing was mainly done for the backend. Here, we have been using JUnit for almost all functions and all controllers. Such tests are useful as we have fixed problems such as improper cascade mapping. Using Maven as our package manager also greatly aided our testing - each time we packaged our code, the tests were run, helping us ensure the code worked as expected before deploying the newest version to the virtual machine.</p>
<p>For the frontend, we used functional and responsive design testing. Functional testing was performed by asking for test users, including our client, for general feedback and to improve on our functionalities. An example bug fix that we found through testing was our search table function - using a library, it had its own function that did not perform well with what we wanted. Testing helped us ensure this functionality was working correctly. Responsive design was performed as the use of mobile devices is key for our requirements and users -  we needed to ensure that our equipment page worked well on these devices.</p>
<h2 id="Documentation"><a href="#Documentation" class="headerlink" title="Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><p>As mentioned in our previous blog, refactoring the code also led us to document the code. Here we used JavaDoc to explicitly show the coding functionality. We also aim to do this for our frontend code.</p>
