                    Having created an application who's interface will be used
                    by a wide range of users, we had to ensure user experience
                    and usability was the top priority. Some features to
                    maintain this include:

                      <p>
                        When equipment is scanned and the user has no access to
                        it, they are taken to a landing page to notify them of
                        this

                    The Clinical QR kit is very functional. It is deployable and
                    has shown to work well over the internet. QR codes direct to
                    the correct pages, with landing pages developed when access
                    to equipment is restricted. These are just a few of the
                    requirements we have implemented and tested; having
                    completed the majority of them, the Clinical QR kit is well
                    functioned.
                  </p>

                    Having not performed any stress/performance testing, it is
                    difficult to conclude whether the system is stable in high
                    stress environments. However with normal use, we have not
                    come across the deployed version crashing the frontend or
                    backend. Tests are always run when the jar is built, both
                    locally and deployed - they ensure the catching of bugs, so
                    unstable code is less likely to be available after
                    deployment.

                    The Clinical QR kit is moderately efficient. Many tasking
                    jobs are performed by the frontend, reducing the workload on
                    the server which needs to run at all times. However, an
                    improvement, as suggested by one of our users in testing,
                    would have been to generate the QR codes on the frontend
                    than generating on the backend. This reduces the need for
                    the server to remake QR codes when needed, reducing workload
                    and improving the solution's efficiency.

                    Having created a website, the application is accessible from
                    devices that are connected to the internet and have an
                    updated web browser. This means, most mobile devices and
                    desktop that are in use currently are compatible with the
                    frontend. In terms of deployment, Java and PostgreSQL will
                    need to be compatible with the system first to run the
                    server and API. Java is very widespread, and PostgreSQL is
                    used on many operating systems, namely Windows, MacOS and
                    Linux systems such as our deployed version on Ubuntu. With
                    this, the Clinical QR Kit is very compatible with modern day
                    architecture.

                    The project is built using great packaging and
                    modularisation. Having using Java and Spring Boot for the
                    backend, code is Object Oriented, which is highly
                    maintainable. The frontend folder has also been created with
                    the correct conventions for frontend development, so
                    potential developers are familiar with the structure and can
                    maintain the code too. The REST API makes it easier for CRUD
                    actions to be added, increasing maintainability

                    The project has had great management. Coding was delegated
                    well, with each member being able to interact wiht different
                    levels of the stack. The gantt chart was used to keep track
                    of progress, as well as a Trello board for assigning tasks
                    later on in development. We also met frequently with our
                    client, and emailed whenever this was not possible.

              QR code generation on frontend: To reduce workload on backend and
              to reduce costs in terms of hosting, QR code generation on the
              frontend would have been great to implement with more time as an
              update feature

            <br />
            <p>
              Increased UI design: The user interface is very simple, however as
              a team we believe it can be made to look more aesthetically
              pleasing whilst maintaining its simplicity. Perhaps different
              themes, a dark mode and more responsive tables could be implmented
              so users can use more devices to access the kit.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Increased testing: This would include performance testing in high
              demand environments. We would also like to test the frontend with
              more unit tests. Continuous integration would work well with
              deployment of code and ensuring tests pass without having to do
              run them manually.
