              ClinicalKitQR is a web application which consists of both frontend
              and backend (with database). Its frontend is the website which
              will be used by the neonatal nurse. Therefore, it is very crucial
              to test our application thoroughly so the user will not encounter
              any problems when trying to have just-in-time learning of the use
              of an equipment.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Our testing is divided into two sections, unit and integration
              testing, and user acceptance testing. Unit and integration testing
              will be mainly focused on testing the functionalities of our
              applications (mainly at the backend). User acceptance testing will
              concentrate on improving the user experience when using our
              website and find any potential bugs when performing actions.

              We have used Junit 5, a popular testing framework to test our
              Spring Boot application. After performing unit and integration
              test to the application, we used JaCoCo library to check the code
              coverage of these testing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Unit tests are written for our controller, they are written to
              test all functions inside a controller, which will be used to
              handle HTTP requests sent from the frontend. This is very
              important as if an error occurred when our backend is handling
              request, the response with the error will be returned to our
              frontend. An example can be if the backend somehow returned
              nothing when the user requested to get the data of an existing
              equipment education page. This will hurt the reliability of our
              system.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Most unit tests are conducted in the following strategy: first
              make up some data, if necessary, then use controller to call then
              function which we are testing. After the function returns the
              result, we will assess the correctness of result.
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-java">testEquipment = equipmentController.getById(testEquipment.getEquipmentId(),testUser.getHospitalId().getHospitalId(),testUser.getUsername());

              assertEquals("updated equipment",testEquipment.getName());
              assertEquals("Gastrointestinal",testEquipment.getType());
              assertEquals("Neonatal",testEquipment.getCategory());
              assertEquals("TEST-4",testEquipment.getModel().getModelName());
              assertEquals("Test Manufacturer",testEquipment.getModel().getManufacturer().getManufacturerName());

            <p>
              If the function is void which means the function does not return
              anything, we will assess the status of the database after the
              function is performed via service. As functions such as saving and
              deleting entities usually does not return anything. We therefore
              need to check our database has saved or delete the entity or not.

              The tests we wrote used a hybrid approach for unit and integration
              testing. We tested controllers in terms of system, a system will
              have one or more controllers. For instance, the login system uses
              trust controller, hospital controller and user group controller.
              When we are testing the functions of controller, we are also
              testing the data transfer between entities in controller.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre><code class="language-java">int originalSize = mailService.getAll().size();
              int originalSentEquipmentSize = sentEquipmentService.getAll().size();
              mailController.send(admin1.getHospitalId().getHospitalId(),admin1.getUsername(),receiverInfo,"test mail","test",time,equipmentIds);
              //test sending a sharing from admin 1 to admin 2 and 3 with multiple equipments shared
              assertEquals(originalSentEquipmentSize+6,sentEquipmentService.getAll().size());
              assertEquals(originalSize+3,mailService.getAll().size());
              </code></pre>
            <p>
              The example above shows the principle of our integration testing.
              When a sharing that contains two equipment is sent from one person
              to the other two person, not only that there are three Mail object
              created and saved to database. But there are also six
              SentEquipment objects created and saved to database. When doing
              unit testing, we will not assert the status of SentEquipment
              database, but for integration testing we will assert both Mail and
              SentEquipment when a sharing is sent as they both belongs to
              sharing system.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              By using both tests, we found by using JaCoCo the code coverage of
              controllers and services is on average 95%.

            </div>
            <br />
            <p>
              The reason why we did not count models’ coverage is because
              models’ functions may not be used in services and controllers
              while it is necessary to be there. An will be for
              UserGroupPrimaryKey, it is used for specifying the composite
              primary key for the UserGroup object, the getter and setter
              functions of this class is not used in the code at all but it is
              necessary to be there.

              Our client is used both on desktop (for admin) and mobile (for
              normal user) platform, so the website should be responsive. So, we
              deploy our client on Azure, and test it on different device. For
              example, 1080p and 2k pc displayer, different size iPad and phone
              with resolution from 720 to 2160 pixel. Also, we use the Chrome
              built in device tool plugin to customise the resolution and try a
              lot device model.

              Testers are carefully selected, each of them represents a kind of
              client user group and their given client account is based on their
              background, such as David and Adam familiar with working using
              computer and have experience using many management system as admin
              or user before. Liz has experience working in hospital and has
              used many similar clients as a user, so she can probably come up
              with a lot of improvement advice and find areas where is not
              convenient and degrade the user experience. Leo as a person who
              worked for a long time but didn't have much use experience, he
              could tell us whether he could understand how to use every
              functionality and tool.

            <p>
              We divided the test into 3 cases, cause our client has three
              different kind of user account, the testers are given account that
              fit their background. The feedback is based on the degree of their
              individual feeling in using tool and convenience of functionality
              on each website page. They could rate each page and leave their
              custom comments.

            <h6>Test Case 1</h6>
            <p>
              We give David a Trust Admin account (which has the highest
              privilege in the client). We ask David to share equipments with
              other admin account and create or edit different type account on
              different hospital or trust, then manipulate all data tables and
              use provided tools. Finally he need to write some Q&A about how to
              use this client for normal user.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h6>Test Case 2</h6>
            <p>
              We give Adam a Hospital Admin (which has the second highest
              privilege in the client). He needs to create lots of equipment and
              include using every tool in our editor (upload image, video or
              file, insert link or video, and change the front style or size
              e.g.) and duel with the user reported issues and generate weekly
              equipment report. In addition, he needs to manage all user group
              in his hospital.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h6>Test Case 3</h6>
            <p>
              We give Liz and Leo normal user account which can only viewing the
              equipment educational page and Q&A, they need to find specific
              equipment by scanning the QR Code or searching keyword involved in
              the equipment information. And they should report some issues
              about any aspects of equipment to inform admin.

              In conclusion of our project partner, he is very satisfied with
              our work and some extra features added. Also, testers feedback
              guides us know how to do some style or component adjustment to
              make it more convenience and mature.
